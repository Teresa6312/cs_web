<h2>Qycs risk assessment</h2>
<p>Although our Qycs and transportation companies are very cautious in handling and transportation, there is still the possibility of loss or damage during shipment. If such an accident occurs, our compensation to the customer is limited, so valuables are not suitable for our mailing service, but customers can also choose direct shipping or buy shipping insurance. In addition, the speed of customs clearance will be less stable during holidays or when encountering natural disasters. We cannot guarantee that the parcel will arrive according to the expected time.</p>
<p>Co-Shipping & Direct shipping insurance: parcels are lost, damage compensation is 5%-20% of each order, according to the specific circumstances</p>

<p>Haitao, item Storage: <i>no insurance</i></p>

<p>For the security of the guests, since we are in the online mode, if the website has security risks or other loopholes, the data information of the website may be leaked under such circumstances, so It is not required to provide too private and personal information related to your life safety. Secondly, our database is built by our own technical team, and the server is also the most secure, which can greatly reduce the risk, so I hope that users can use our services more confidently.</p>

<p>For Qycs, as a startup company, if the promotion and marketing are not doing good, or the freight rate of the transportation channel increases, the number of collection points and users in different cities even countries will not be improved independently, then the company has no way to achieve the expected profit within the specified time. Therefore, I sincerely hope that everyone can support us, give more valuable advice, and give us more feedback.
