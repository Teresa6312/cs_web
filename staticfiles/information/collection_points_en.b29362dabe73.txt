<h2>Collection Points</h2>
<p>One of our QYCS' advantages in our mailing service is that the cost of mailing is low, and the way we reduce the cost of mailing is to lower the mailing threshold: no first weight, co-mailing and global mailing. In this regard, our collection points are indispensable. We build our collection points network by adopting global customer-created collection points. On QYCS' official website, users can register their personal address or store address as the collection point. After successful registration, the collector will earn a commission based on the number of packages received. Customers using the mailing service can send their purchased items to our warehouse, add mailling packages on our official website and choose a collection point to achieve the shipping. As the collection points are more and more self-created, QYCS's shipping service can be spread to different cities and even communities around the world, users will increase, and also fasten the speed of shipping.</p>
